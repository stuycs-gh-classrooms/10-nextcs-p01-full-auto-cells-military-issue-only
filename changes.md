## Changes to our project
These are changes that we're going to make to our project, based on the issues/feedback other groups gave.

1. We could add a variable that stores which phase is "dominating" (day or night) and then draw the corresponding image (sun or moon) when the grid has been completely filled up with a single color. That way, the program will know when it should start drawing the image and what image it should draw.
